The objective of the project is to make a program that is capable by means of the bisection method to calculate the root of a function in a given interval.

## Functions

The algorithm must be capable of finding the root for these functions

1. $ f(x) = 2cos(x^2) $
2. $ f(x) = 3x^3 + 7x^2 + 5 $
3. $ f(x) = xcos(x) $
